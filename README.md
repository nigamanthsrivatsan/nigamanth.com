Hello! This is a very simple portfolio website to describe my digital world. <br>
It uses a dark theme by default, with the option to customize the user's theme. 

```yml
Hosting: GitHub Pages
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Font Used: Graphik
Website: https://nigamanth.com/
```

**Note:** This website wasn't made to be open source - but I realized since it's very basic why not put it on GitHub?
<br> If there are any issues with the website, or you would like to contribute to the website, please open an issue/pull request.
